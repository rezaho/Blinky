## Overview

**Blinky** is a companion robot platform developed to facilitate research on embodied AI. Blinky is designed to be open-source, modular, and to support basic human interaction hardware (such as cameras, microphones, speakers, displays, etc.).  
Blinky utilizes NVIDIA Jetson for its main AI processing capabilities, with custom PCBs designed for battery and power management, BLDC motor driver boards, and more.  
Using the custom CAD design and URDF specifications for Blinky, we will initially train Blinky in NVIDIA Isaac Lab to develop specific locomotion algorithms to control its actuators. Subsequently, Blinky will employ advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to follow instructions and perform simple tasks in the real world (such as following a person, moving to a specific location, analyzing its surroundings, bringing/sorting objects, etc.). Blinky is designed to be a cute and versatile companion, enhancing human-robot interaction.

## Milestones

- Designing the initial mechanical design and CAD/URDF files
- Designing custom PCBs/circuitry boards for different robotic subsystems (actuators, power and battery management, display, etc.)
- Providing a complete Bill of Materials (BOM) and guidelines to build the robotic platform
- Training the locomotion algorithms in NVIDIA Isaac Lab
- Integrating VLA (Vision-Language-Action) models for instruction following and execution of simple tasks
